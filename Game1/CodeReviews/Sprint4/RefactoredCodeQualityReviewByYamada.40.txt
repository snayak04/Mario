Comments:
The coupling remains as loose as possible after refactoring.  The class still only handles one thing, the camera function for the game, thereby remaining highly cohesive.
I do not think there is anything that I could do to improve upon this code.  Everyline concisely addresses its functions as necessary.  There does not appear to be any
unneeded code.
