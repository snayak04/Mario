MarioObjectCollisionResponse.cs
Michael Yamada

All of the methods and classes for the "is" checks are very easy to read and clearly labelled.
The class is only doing one thing, handling the collision response of mario and the object, only depends on those two objects.
The two functional methods that nothing else needs are private and hidden.
Very cohesive, what coupling there is can't really be avoided, very low dependency.
