Specific comments on code quality
The length of the class is reasonable.
All the class is for a specfic function: setting the response after collision between Mario and Item.

A hypothetical change: Create a seperate class to handle all changes in Game g. Such as blocks remove/add. This change will decrease the lines in the class.
