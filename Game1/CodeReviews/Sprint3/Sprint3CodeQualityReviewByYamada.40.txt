Comments:
The enemy collistion response is highly cohesive as it handles only one function: enemy collision response.  Readability is
high with no extra code necessary.  Coupling seems to be stronger than weak due to the nature of the function.  I don't
this can be avoided though as all three parameters are necessary.

I can not think of any improvements to this code.
