Specific comments on code quality
Class is short, and does specific task; creates objects(star, flower, mushrooms, etc.).
The code seems pretty loosely coupled, and has decent cohesion. The class uses File loader and reads the map and stores them in a list of object. However, I think in future we will get rid of this class.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change 
Let's say, we want to add a new object, as of current implementation, we will have to update this class, add the object to the object generation. So overall, the class is somewhat loosely cohesive.
