Comments:
The EnterNameState is high in cohesion and relatively loosely coupled. The class only handles the keyboard input and writing the 
input to a file all related to the logging the name associated with the high score.

This class follows the state pattern and treats this particular function as a separate state of the various game states
for this program.  It handles all the functions related to this one particular theme, entering the user's name to be associated
with the high score.  The implementation could possibly be loosened a little further by finding a way to encapsulate the game (g)
reference into a method call to handle using the game reference's specific call.
