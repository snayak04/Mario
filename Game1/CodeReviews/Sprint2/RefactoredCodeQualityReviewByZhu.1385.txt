This class is not changed in the refactoring process so I would keep my original commnets as below:
Specific comments on code quality
The number of lines in the class and each property are reasanable.
No redundant method or variable.
All methods are concise
Easy to maintain as he showed the variables clearly and separetaly such as how to get them.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
Making the mystery block moving. Change the location.X in destinationRectangle and increment it in Update().
