Sprint number: 2

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: BigMarioLeftWalkingState

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Minghao Zhu

Specific comments on code quality: Clear coding practice fields followed camelCase styles, and the methods are PascalCase styles. Implemented the method headers that were implemented in the IMario interface.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

As per the current implementation of the Mario, whenever we would need to change a certain state's functionality, it can be done by simply going to its specific class and update the previous implementation or create a new method.
