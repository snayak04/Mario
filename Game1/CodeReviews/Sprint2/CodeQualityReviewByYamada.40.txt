Comments:
The draw method is concise with as few lines of code necessary to implement it.  Update method was even shorter (no code).

A hypothetical change could be a change to the texture atlas for the FireMarioRightJumpingTextureAtlas.  This class could easily handle a change to the imagery as what ever texture is passed in becomes the new FireMarioRightJumpingTextureAtlas.
