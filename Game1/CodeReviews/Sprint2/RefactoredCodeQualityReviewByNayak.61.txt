Specific comments on code quality
Class is short, and does specific task. It draws a turtle sprite when invoked through another class. The longest method being of around 10 lines.
The code seems pretty loosely coupled, and has decent cohesion. The class uses rows and columns to animate the sprite (Turtle)

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change 
Let's say, we want a create a new sprite sheet for Turtle with different rows and columns, the current implementation would not easily support that change. He will have to make some changes to rows and columns.
