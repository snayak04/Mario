Specific comments on code quality
No redundant method or variable.
All methods are concise
Easy to maintain as he showed the variables clearly and separetaly such as how to get them.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
Making the mystery block moving. Change the location.X in destinationRectangle and increment it in Update().
