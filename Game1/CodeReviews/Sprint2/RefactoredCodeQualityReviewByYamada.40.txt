Comments:
The constructor and Draw method remained the same in lines of code.  Both were well under the required limit of lines of code.  The Draw method having only five 
lines of code would indicate that the method performs its task sufficiently with so few lines.  The code appears to have high cohesion as all functions within 
the class are focused on drawing.  The dependencies seems a bit on the strong side as the constructor depends on the Texture2D class and the Draw depends on the
SpriteBatch and Vector2 classes.  This would imply that the coupling is higher than it is lower given all the dependencies.
