Comments:
The PlayGameState is lower in cohesion and tightly coupled, but that would be the nature of this class as it handles
all the various game functions related to game play as it title reflects.  Passing the game object to different 
classes.  The update method consilidated the different objects in the game and some into arrays to neetly got through
each one and update or remove them from use. The draw function handles all the relavent object's drawing. 

Given the nature of this class, it follows the singleton pattern however is not called via a private constuctor but 
it behaves in a manner similar to a singleton.  This singletonish nature makes it difficult to find anywhere to improve 
upon the quality of this code except for strictly employing the singleton pattern for this GamePlayState, b/c there can
only be one GamePlayState, multiple instances of this would break the program.  However the nature of the state pattern 
implies that there can only be one state being executed at a time.
